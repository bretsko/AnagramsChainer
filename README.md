# AnagramsChainer
The program constructs the longest possible chain of consecutive anagrams from the input word and a dictionary (in C++).
Works on Linux (depends on getopt, pthreads for googletest).

Example: ./anagram_finder -w mean 

Anagram derivation result:

Found 12 anagrams: 

mean -> Medan, admen, amend, named -> Madden, damned, demand, madden -> amended -> demanded, maddened
